# FPL (Fundamentals of Programming Languages) Assignment

## Pune University

This repository contains my college assignment for the FPL course, where I explored various operators in programming languages.

### Operators Implemented

1. **Assignment Operator**
   - Demonstrated how to assign values to variables.

2. **Ternary Operator**
   - Implemented a conditional expression that evaluates to one of two values based on a boolean condition.

3. **Unary Operator**
   - Illustrated the use of operators that operate on a single operand, such as increment and decrement.

4. **Bitwise Operator**
   - Showed how to perform operations at the bit level, including AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and shifts.

5. **Arithmetic Operator**
   - Covered basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

6. **Logical Operator**
   - Explored logical operations, including AND, OR, and NOT.

7. **Relational Operator**
   - Demonstrated comparisons between variables, such as equal to, not equal to, greater than, and less than.
